# AgentPM Prototype

**Local-First AI Project Management System**

AgentPM is a **fully functional** local-first AI project management system that provides quality gates, verification pipelines, and proof capture capabilities. This repository serves as the development and testing environment for the AgentPM prototype.

> **SSOT:** The canonical plan for StoryMaker + AgentPM lives at  
> `docs/SSOT/MASTER_PLAN.md` (v1.6 FINAL). Rebuilds must follow that document exactly.
>
> **AgentPM Rails:** Rules are authored in `docs/SSOT/rules/*.mdc` and are
> synced into `.cursor/rules/` by `make rules-sync`. Proofs are **only**
> written to `docs/proofs/agentpm/` (workspace proofs folder is a symlink).

**‚úÖ INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: All AgentPM integration issues have been resolved. The system is now fully operational for both development and production use with comprehensive mock mode support.

**Note**: This repository uses StoryMaker as a testbed application for validating AgentPM capabilities, but StoryMaker itself is a separate, classified project.

### Architecture Guardrails (No Mocks)

* `DISABLE_MOCKS=1`, `MOCK_LMS=0` are enforced in env, runtime, and CI.
* Creative = **Groq** only; Embeddings/Rerank/Planning = **LM Studio** only.
* Verification MUST produce envelopes under `docs/proofs/agentpm/`.
* Guards hard-fail if any mock/fallback path is detected.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Zero Manual Intervention)

### **One-Command Bootstrap**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iog-creator/storymaker-bundle-v1.6.git
cd storymaker-bundle-v1.6-unified-full
make bootstrap
```

**That's it!** The system handles everything automatically:
- ‚úÖ Environment setup and validation
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure startup (Docker services)
- ‚úÖ LM Studio integration detection
- ‚úÖ AgentPM workspace initialization
- ‚úÖ Rules sync and enforcement
- ‚úÖ Complete system verification

### **What the Bootstrap Does**

1. **Environment Auto-Setup**
   - Copies `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env`
   - Validates required environment variables
   - Sets up AgentPM workspace structure

2. **Infrastructure Auto-Start**
   - Starts Docker services (Postgres, Redis, MinIO)
   - Waits for services to be ready
   - Validates database connectivity

3. **LM Studio Integration**
   - Detects LM Studio installation
   - Validates model availability
   - Confirms API endpoint accessibility

4. **AgentPM Workspace Bootstrap**
   - Creates canonical proofs directory
   - Sets up workspace symlinks
   - Syncs SSOT rules to Cursor
   - Enforces all guardrails

5. **System Verification**
   - Runs complete verification suite
   - Generates both LM Studio and Groq proofs
   - Validates all quality gates

### **Post-Bootstrap Usage**
```bash
# Start all services
make start

# Check status
make status

# Run verification
make verify-all
```

### Canonical proofs location (MANDATORY)
All verifier evidence and narrative proofs MUST live under:

```
docs/proofs/agentpm/
```

Anything outside this path fails the proofs guard.

### **Optional: LM Studio Setup**
For full AI capabilities, install LM Studio:
1. Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Load Qwen chat + embedding models
3. Start server on port 1234

The system works without LM Studio but with limited AI features.

### Step 3: Use AgentPM
- **Testbed Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:8000-8004
- **Verification**: `make verify-all`

## üìñ What AgentPM Does

### Core Features
- **Local-First AI**: No cloud dependencies, full privacy
- **Quality Gates**: Multi-step verification and validation
- **Envelope System**: Consistent JSON response format
- **Proof Capture**: Automatic audit trail for all operations
- **LM Studio Integration**: Local AI models for all operations
- **Local-First AI**: All operations use local LM Studio models ‚úÖ
- **All Tests Pass**: Complete verification suite working ‚úÖ

### Testbed Application Services
- **Worldcore** (port 8000): World building, lore, and universe management
- **Narrative** (port 8001): Story generation, plot development, and pacing
- **Screenplay** (port 8002): Script formatting, dialogue, and scene structure
- **Media** (port 8003): Image generation and multimedia content
- **Interact** (port 8004): User interactions and chat interface

*Note: The testbed application is used to validate AgentPM capabilities but is a separate, classified project.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
# AgentPM Verification
make verify-all     # Run all AgentPM verification checks
make config-check   # Check environment configuration
make verify-lms     # Test LM Studio integration
make verify-preflight # Run preflight quality gates

# System Management
make start          # Start everything
make status         # Check if services are running
make stop           # Stop all services
make restart        # Restart services
make help           # Show all commands

# AgentPM Status
scripts/bootstrap.sh status  # Check AgentPM status
scripts/run.sh bash -lc 'command'  # Run commands with AgentPM environment
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Verify everything is working
make verify-all
# Expected: ‚úÖ ALL VERIFICATIONS PASSED

# Check AgentPM status
scripts/bootstrap.sh status
# Expected: ‚úÖ LM Studio running with X models
```

### "LM Studio not found" (Production Mode)
- Make sure LM Studio is running
- Check that the server is on port 1234
- Try: `curl http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/models`

### "Database connection failed"
- Run: `make restart`
- Check Docker is running: `docker ps`

### "Services won't start"
- Check port conflicts: `make status`
- View logs: `docker compose logs`
- Restart: `make restart`

### AgentPM Issues
- **Environment wrapper fails**: Test `scripts/run.sh bash -lc 'echo "test"'`
- **Verification failures**: Run individual checks (`make config-check`, `make verify-lms`, etc.)
