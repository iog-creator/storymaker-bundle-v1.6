# AgentPM Prototype

**Local-First AI Project Management System**

AgentPM is a prototype system for local-first AI project management that provides quality gates, verification pipelines, and proof capture capabilities. This repository serves as the development and testing environment for the AgentPM prototype.

**Note**: This repository uses StoryMaker as a testbed application for validating AgentPM capabilities, but StoryMaker itself is a separate, classified project.

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- **LM Studio** (download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai))
- **Docker** (for database)
- **Git** (to clone this repo)

### Step 1: Start LM Studio
1. Open LM Studio
2. Load any chat model (e.g., `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`)
3. Click "Start Server" (should show port 1234)

### Step 2: Start AgentPM
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iog-creator/storymaker-bundle-v1.6.git
cd storymaker-bundle-v1.6-unified-full
make start
```

That's it! AgentPM will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check LM Studio connection
- ‚úÖ Start the testbed application
- ‚úÖ Start all services
- ‚úÖ Verify everything works

### Step 3: Use AgentPM
- **Testbed Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:8000-8004

## üìñ What AgentPM Does

### Core Features
- **Local-First AI**: No cloud dependencies, full privacy
- **Quality Gates**: Multi-step verification and validation
- **Envelope System**: Consistent JSON response format
- **Proof Capture**: Automatic audit trail for all operations
- **LM Studio Integration**: Local AI models for all operations

### Testbed Application Services
- **Worldcore** (port 8000): World building, lore, and universe management
- **Narrative** (port 8001): Story generation, plot development, and pacing
- **Screenplay** (port 8002): Script formatting, dialogue, and scene structure
- **Media** (port 8003): Image generation and multimedia content
- **Interact** (port 8004): User interactions and chat interface

*Note: The testbed application is used to validate AgentPM capabilities but is a separate, classified project.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
make start      # Start everything
make status     # Check if services are running
make stop       # Stop all services
make restart    # Restart services
make help       # Show all commands
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "LM Studio not found"
- Make sure LM Studio is running
- Check that the server is on port 1234
- Try: `curl http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/models`

### "Database connection failed"
- Run: `make restart`
- Check Docker is running: `docker ps`

### "Services won't start"
- Check port conflicts: `make status`
- View logs: `docker compose logs`
- Restart: `make restart`
