# StoryMaker Development Log

## 2024-01-XX - Chat History Recovery Session

### Context
- Lost chat history from previous Cursor session
- Recovering work from git changes and project state
- Implementing chat history backup strategy

### Work in Progress (From Git Status)
- **AgentPM Development**: Multiple AgentPM files modified
  - `AGENTPM_DEVELOPMENT.md`
  - `AGENTPM_INTEGRATION.md` 
  - `AGENTPM_PAIN_POINTS.md`
  - `AGENTPM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (new)

- **New Services**: 
  - `services/narrative/scribe/` - New scribe service
  - Enhanced tests for multiple services

- **Configuration**:
  - `.env.config` - New environment configuration
  - Various script improvements

- **Documentation**:
  - `PR_0000.md` - New PR documentation
  - `verification_v1.6.md` - New verification system

### Key Decisions Made
1. Implement chat history backup strategy
2. Use git commits to preserve work progress
3. Create development log for tracking decisions

### Next Steps
1. Review and commit current changes
2. Test the new scribe service
3. Run verification suite
4. Document any issues found

### Chat History Prevention Strategy
- Always commit work before closing Cursor
- Use this development log for important decisions
- Export important chat sessions when possible
- Keep workspace path consistent

### Chat History Backup System (2024-09-08)
**Problem**: Cursor keeps losing chat history and work. This has happened twice now.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Automated Backup Script**: `scripts/backup_cursor_chats.sh`
   - Backs up workspace storage to compressed archives
   - Keeps last 10 backups automatically
   - Run regularly to prevent data loss

2. **Restore Script**: `scripts/restore_cursor_chats.sh`
   - Restores chat history from backups
   - Creates safety backup before restore
   - Interactive restore process

3. **Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Backup chat history (run regularly)
   ./scripts/backup_cursor_chats.sh
   
   # Restore from backup (when history is lost)
   ./scripts/restore_cursor_chats.sh
   ```

4. **Prevention Measures**:
   - Run backup script before major Cursor updates
   - Keep workspace path consistent (don't rename/move project folders)
   - Monitor disk space before updates
   - Export critical conversations to markdown files

**Status**: Backup system implemented and ready for use.
