# ðŸŒŒ StoryMaker Master Plan (Conceptual Blueprint)

## 1. Vision
StoryMaker is a **creative ecosystem** where AI and human co-build worlds and tell stories inside them. It remembers canon, avoids contradictions, and generates at multiple levels: **worlds â†’ outlines â†’ scenes â†’ dialogue â†’ media**.

## 2. Roles
- **Human (Author)**: seeds ideas, approves canon.
- **Groq 70B (Creative Brain)**: prose, dialogue, rewrites, line edits.
- **LM Studio (Local Models)**: embeddings, reranking, QA checks (trope budget, promise/payoff).
- **AgentPM**: validator/PM (rules, proofs, drift blocks).
- **Cursor**: builder/engineer (PRs).

## 3. Core Modules
**WorldCore**: entities + workflow **Propose â†’ Approve â†’ Canon** (immutable).  
**Narrative**: creative generation (Groq 70B) with envelope outputs.  
**Screenplay**: structure/formatting (Fountain/FDX/PDF).  
**Media**: art/audio, always watermarked.  
**Interact**: NPC chat proposing facts (never mutates canon).

## 4. Flow
Bootstrap â†’ World Building (propose/approve) â†’ Outline â†’ Scene â†’ Screenplay/Media â†’ Interaction â†’ **Proofs & Validation** (envelopes for every action).

## 5. Principles
Fail-closed â€¢ Immutable canon â€¢ Auditability (proofs) â€¢ Provider split (Groq=creative, LM Studio=QA) â€¢ Human in the loop.

## 6. Phases
P1 Core services âœ… â€¢ P2 AI integration âœ… â€¢ **P3 Web UI âœ…** â€¢ P4 Validation & QA ðŸš§ â€¢ P5 Launch ðŸš€

## 7. Why this matters
Avoids clichÃ©s/contradictions; characters stay in voice; timelines align; **promises are paid off**; every draft traceable via proofs.
