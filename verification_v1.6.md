- Content generation testing
- Error handling testing
- Pydantic V2 compatibility

**✅ Quality Assurance:**
- All existing tests still pass
- No linting errors
- Pydantic V2 migration complete
- Proper error handling throughout

### **🔧 Technical Improvements**

### **📊 Acceptance Tests Status**

All Phase 1 acceptance tests are now implemented and passing:

- ✅ **DB Health Gate** → `/health` returns `{ok:true}` only when DB reachable
- ✅ **Idempotent Approval** → double-approve same CID → identical pointer
- ✅ **Temporal Guards** → unit tests pass (`services/guards/{temporal,allen_lite}.py`)
- ✅ **Promise/Payoff** → orphans/extraneous flagged by `/narrative/outline`
- ✅ **Trope Budget** → clichés over threshold yield `issues: [{type: "trope_budget"}]`
- ✅ **Screenplay Export** → `/screenplay/export` returns artifact envelope (FDX/Fountain)
- ✅ **NPC Session (WS)** → unknown/invent prompts return `PROPOSE_FACT`; canon not mutated
- ✅ **Visual Generate** → returns watermark metadata `{present:true}`

### **🚀 Ready for Phase 2**

The foundation is now solid for Phase 2: AI & Content Generation. The services are:
- Fully functional with comprehensive APIs
- Well-tested with extensive test coverage
- Ready for LM Studio integration
- Prepared for real content generation
- Following all SRS v1.1 requirements

**Phase 1 is complete and ready for production use!** 🎉
